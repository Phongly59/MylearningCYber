another common encoding shcme is base64, which allows us to represent binary data as an ASCII string using an alphabet of 64 characters. One character of a base64 string encodes 6 binary digits(bits), and so 4 characters of base64 encode three 8-bit bytes


base64 is most commonly used online, so binary data such as images  can be easily included into HTML or CSS files.

Take the code below hex string, decode it into bytes and then encode it into base64

IN python , after importing the base64 module with import base64, you can use the base64.b64encode() function. Remember to decode the first ad the challenge description states

base64 (a-z,A-Z, 0-9)

quy tắc thêm padding 
+ nếu thiếu 2 bit ở nhóm cuối thì cần thêm 1 kí tự paddung

+nếu thiếu 4 bit , cần thêm 2 ký tự padding(==)

nếu ko thiếu thì ko add
