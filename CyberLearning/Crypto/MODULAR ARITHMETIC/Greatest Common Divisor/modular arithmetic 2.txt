We'll pick up from the last challenge and imagine we've picked a modulus 
p
p, and we will restrict ourselves to the case when 
p
p is prime.

The integers modulo 
p
p define a field, denoted 
F
p
F 
p
​
 .

If the modulus is not prime, the set of integers modulo 
n
n define a ring.


A finite field 
F
p
F 
p
​
  is the set of integers 
0

p

0,1,...,p−1, and under both addition and multiplication there are inverse elements 
b

b

​
  and 
b
∗
b

​
  for every element 
a
a in the set, such that 
a

b

=
0
a+b

​
 =0 and 
a

b

a⋅b

 =1.

 Note that the identity element for addition and multiplication is different! This is because the identity when acted with the operator should do nothing: 
a

0
=
a
a+0=a and 
a

=
a
a⋅1=a.


Lets say we pick 
p
=

p=17. Calculate

 mod17. Now do the same but with 
5
17
m
o
d
17
5 
17
 mod17.

What would you expect to get for 
7
16
m
o
d
17
7

 mod17? Try calculating that.

This interesting fact is known as Fermat's little theorem. We'll be needing this (and its generalisations) when we look at RSA cryptography.

Now take the prime 
p
=
65537
p=65537. Calculate
