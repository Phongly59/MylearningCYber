As we've seen, we can work within a finite field 
F
p
F

 , adding and multiplying elements, and always obtain another element of the field.

For all elements 
g
g in the field, there exists a unique integer 
d
d such that 
g
⋅
d
≡
1
m
o
d
p
g⋅d≡1modp.

This is the multiplicative inverse of 
g
g.

Example: 
7
⋅
8

56
≡

m
o
d
11
7⋅8=56≡1mod11

What is the inverse element: 
d
=
3

1
d=3

  such that 
3

d
≡
1
m
o
d
13
3⋅d≡1mod13?

 Think about the little theorem we just worked with. How does this help you find the inverse of an element?
